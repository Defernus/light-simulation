# Simple physic accurate light simulation

## Progress
- [] Camera (center of the world, all object will be calculated relative to the camera).
- [] Light particles (photons) and light sources (stars).
- [] Mass and gravity.
- [] Black holes.
- [] Use wgpu for calculation.
- [] realtime rendering? (maybe not).
